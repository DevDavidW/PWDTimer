# PWDTimer

**Pinewood Derby Race Timer** created by David Gadberry and obtained from https://www.dfgtec.com/pdt 

This was modified some to fit the needs of our pack. 
Our old timer used 9.999 as the non-finish time so that was changed and we use 4 lanes. 
Added ability to enable a timeout of a lane when it exceeds the NULL_TIME.
